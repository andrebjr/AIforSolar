Computer vision technology can significantly enhance the efficiency of solar companies by automating the inspection and maintenance of solar panels, detecting defects or debris that may reduce energy production. It can also optimize the placement of solar arrays by analyzing satellite imagery and topographical data to identify ideal locations for maximum sun exposure. Computer vision can improve safety and reduce costs for solar installers by enabling drone-based surveys of rooftops and large-scale solar farms, eliminating the need for manual inspections in potentially hazardous conditions.
